Our analysis focuses on five explosive power metrics selected based on their robust representation within the SBU athletics database: Jump Height, Peak Propulsive Force, Peak Velocity, Propulsive Net Impulse, and Modified Reactive Strength Index (mRSI). These metrics were chosen because they demonstrate strong sample sizes across multiple teams with consistent temporal coverage, enabling meaningful longitudinal and comparative analyses.

Jump height, measured through countermovement jumps, represents the most fundamental metric of explosive lower-body power and has become one of the most frequently used tests by coaches and researchers (Markovic, 2007). Research demonstrates that plyometric training produces statistically significant improvements in vertical jump height, with effect sizes ranging from approximately 5% for squat jumps to 9% for countermovement jumps (De Villarreal et al., 2009). In professional basketball, greater vertical jump height has been strongly correlated with playing time in NCAA Division I athletes, highlighting its relevance for competitive selection and performance evaluation (Hoffman et al., 1996). Training interventions demonstrate that improvements in jump performance occur principally through increased countermovement magnitude and maintaining high concentric forces for longer periods (Morris et al., 2022). However, research emphasizes that jump height alone may not be a systematically reliable indicator of power output capacity without contextual analysis of force-time metrics.

Peak propulsive force represents the maximum vertical ground reaction force generated during the concentric phase of a jump, providing direct insight into biomechanical efficiency during explosive movements. This metric demonstrates high reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 (Hori et al., 2009). Athletes demonstrating peak force at the low position of the countermovement show more efficient unweighting and braking phase characteristics compared to those reaching peak force at different movement phases (McHugh et al., 2021). Elite high jumpers generate peak vertical forces ranging from approximately 2,600N to 3,400N during take-off, demonstrating the magnitude of force production in specialized jumping athletes (Linthorne, 2001).

Peak velocity quantifies the maximum upward speed of the center of mass during the propulsive phase of jumping and represents the culmination of force application. This metric demonstrates exceptional reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.98 in research settings (Hori et al., 2009). The biomechanical relationship between force, velocity, and power makes peak velocity a critical indicator of an athlete’s ability to rapidly accelerate their body mass, with this quality transferring directly to sprint acceleration and change of direction speed (Samozino et al., 2012). Research on force-velocity profiles reveals that individual athletes demonstrate varying characteristics, with some showing force-dominant profiles while others exhibit velocity-dominant patterns, suggesting the value of comprehensive profiling approaches (Samozino et al., 2012).

Propulsive net impulse represents the net vertical impulse applied to the system center of mass during the propulsive phase of a jump, quantifying the total force applied over time according to the impulse-momentum theorem. This metric is mechanically fundamental to jump performance as it represents the cumulative effect of force application over the entire push-off duration (Linthorne, 2001). Athletes can achieve similar jump heights through different combinations of force magnitude and application time, making impulse analysis valuable for understanding individual neuromuscular strategies (Dowling & Vamos, 1993). Training intervention studies demonstrate improved performance through maintaining high concentric forces for longer periods, with the temporal pattern of force application significantly impacting jumping efficiency (Morris et al., 2022).

The modified reactive strength index has emerged as a critical metric for assessing an athlete’s reactive jump capacity and ability to cope with and perform plyometric activities. RSI is calculated by dividing jump height by ground contact time or time to take-off, creating a ratio that captures both performance outcome and movement efficiency in a single value (Young, 1995). This metric describes an individual’s capability to quickly transition from eccentric to concentric muscle contraction and can be used to monitor, assess, and reduce injury risk (Flanagan et al., 2008). Research demonstrates that RSI naturally decreases through heavy training cycles and with accumulated load, making it valuable for monitoring fatigue and athlete readiness (Ramirez-Campillo et al., 2022).

Despite extensive research on individual explosive power metrics, several critical gaps exist in the literature. First, comprehensive comparisons of explosive power metrics across different team sports within the same competitive level remain limited, particularly at the NCAA Division I collegiate level. Second, systematic longitudinal tracking across competitive seasons integrating multiple explosive power metrics is rarely reported in team sport settings. Most intervention studies last between six and sixteen weeks, missing seasonal variation patterns crucial for understanding how athletes respond to periodized training and competition stress. Third, comprehensive analysis of how multiple explosive power metrics relate to each other in creating distinct athlete profiles remains underdeveloped.

**Research Question and Rationale**

The primary research question addresses a critical gap in athletic monitoring: **Does Propulsive Net Impulse provide additional information about athlete performance and readiness beyond what is captured by Jump Height alone?** While jump height represents the outcome of a jump, propulsive net impulse reveals the underlying neuromechanical strategy used to achieve that outcome. Athletes can maintain consistent jump heights while demonstrating significant changes in how they generate that height through altered force magnitudes or ground contact times.

This distinction is particularly important for athlete readiness and injury risk. An athlete experiencing neuromuscular fatigue may unconsciously adopt compensatory strategies that preserve jump height while requiring greater effort—for example, “muscling through” the movement with extended ground contact time despite reduced force production capacity. This strategic shift would be invisible in jump height data alone but evident in propulsive net impulse patterns. By examining longitudinal relationships between these metrics, this analysis will investigate cases where jump height remains stable but impulse changes significantly. Establishing evidence-based thresholds—such as flagging athletes whose propulsive net impulse falls 10% below their 4-week rolling average while jump height remains constant—will provide coaches with objective criteria for identifying athletes requiring intervention or modified training loads.

The broader investigation examines how explosive power profiles differ across SBU athletic teams and what longitudinal patterns emerge across competitive seasons. This will provide normative ranges for each metric by sport at the Division I collegiate level, filling a critical gap in published benchmarking data. By tracking athletes across full competitive seasons, the research will characterize how explosive power naturally fluctuates with training periodization, competition schedules, and recovery demands. The analysis will investigate correlations between metrics, revealing whether distinct explosive power profiles emerge that may inform individualized development programs.

This analysis offers value for both scientific and practical applications. Scientifically, it will contribute collegiate-level normative data across multiple sports and advance understanding of how different components of explosive power interact. Practically, strength and conditioning coaches will gain sport-specific benchmarks for assessing recruit potential, individualized performance tracking, early warning indicators of performance decline or overtraining, and data-driven evaluation tools for training program effectiveness. The development of evidence-based performance monitoring systems, including objective criteria for identifying athletes requiring intervention, will support proactive load management and injury risk reduction strategies.
