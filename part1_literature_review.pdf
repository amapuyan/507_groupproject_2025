Our analysis focuses on five explosive power metrics selected based on their robust representation within the SBU athletics database: Jump Height, Peak Propulsive Force, Peak Velocity, Propulsive Net Impulse, and Modified Reactive Strength Index (mRSI). These metrics were chosen because they demonstrate strong sample sizes across multiple teams with consistent temporal coverage, enabling meaningful longitudinal and comparative analyses. Jump height, measured through countermovement jumps, represents the most fundamental metric of explosive lower-body power and has become one of the most frequently used tests by coaches and researchers (Markovic, 2007). Research demonstrates that plyometric training produces statistically significant improvements in vertical jump height, with effect sizes ranging from approximately 5% for squat jumps to 9% for countermovement jumps (De Villarreal et al., 2009). In professional basketball, greater vertical jump height has been strongly correlated with playing time in NCAA Division I athletes, highlighting its relevance for competitive selection and performance evaluation (Hoffman et al., 1996). Jump performance serves as a valid measure of lower limb explosive power, strength, and muscle fiber composition, making it essential for sports requiring acceleration, change of direction, and aerial dominance. Training interventions demonstrate that improvements in jump performance occur principally through increased countermovement magnitude and maintaining high concentric forces for longer periods (Morris et al., 2022). Research emphasizes that body composition significantly impacts jump performance and that jump height alone may not be a systematically reliable indicator of power output capacity without contextual analysis of force-time metrics.
Peak propulsive force represents the maximum vertical ground reaction force generated during the concentric phase of a jump, providing direct insight into biomechanical efficiency during explosive movements. This metric, obtained directly from force plate measurements, demonstrates high reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 (Hori et al., 2009). Athletes demonstrating peak force at the low position of the countermovement show more efficient unweighting and braking phase characteristics compared to those reaching peak force at different movement phases (McHugh et al., 2021). Elite high jumpers generate peak vertical forces ranging from approximately 2,600N to 3,400N during take-off, demonstrating the magnitude of force production in specialized jumping athletes (Linthorne, 2001). Research indicates that as performance intensity increases during explosive movements, different neuromuscular strategies emerge across performance contexts, with male athletes typically exhibiting higher peak propulsive forces compared to females (Bobbert & Van Soest, 1994).
Peak velocity quantifies the maximum upward speed of the center of mass during the propulsive phase of jumping and represents the culmination of force application. This metric demonstrates exceptional reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.98 in research settings, making it a highly dependable measure for performance monitoring and longitudinal tracking (Hori et al., 2009). The biomechanical relationship between force, velocity, and power makes peak velocity a critical indicator of an athlete's ability to rapidly accelerate their body mass, with this quality transferring directly to sprint acceleration and change of direction speed (Samozino et al., 2012). Peak velocity is a direct determinant of jump height through kinematic equations, and velocity-based metrics may be more sensitive to training-induced adaptations than force or power measures alone (Jiménez-Reyes et al., 2017). Research on force-velocity profiles reveals that individual athletes demonstrate varying characteristics, with some showing force-dominant profiles while others exhibit velocity-dominant patterns, suggesting the value of comprehensive profiling approaches that consider multiple metrics simultaneously (Samozino et al., 2012).
Propulsive net impulse represents the net vertical impulse applied to the system center of mass during the propulsive phase of a jump, quantifying the total force applied over time according to the impulse-momentum theorem. This metric is mechanically fundamental to jump performance as it represents the cumulative effect of force application over the entire push-off duration (Linthorne, 2001). Athletes can achieve similar jump heights through different combinations of force magnitude and application time, making impulse analysis valuable for understanding individual neuromuscular strategies (Dowling & Vamos, 1993). Maximizing center of mass velocity at take-off equates to maximizing net impulse, typically through increasing mean concentric force or minimizing eccentric time (Aura & Viitasalo, 1989). Training intervention studies demonstrate improved performance through maintaining high concentric forces for longer periods, with the temporal pattern of force application significantly impacting jumping efficiency (Morris et al., 2022).
The modified reactive strength index has emerged as a critical metric for assessing an athlete's reactive jump capacity and ability to cope with and perform plyometric activities. RSI is calculated by dividing jump height by ground contact time or time to take-off, creating a ratio that captures both performance outcome and movement efficiency in a single value (Young, 1995). This metric describes an individual's capability to quickly transition from eccentric to concentric muscle contraction and can be used to monitor, assess, and reduce injury risk (Flanagan et al., 2008). Meta-analysis reveals moderate associations between RSI and strength, moderate negative associations with acceleration and top speed, and large negative associations with change of direction speed, establishing RSI as a key performance indicator across multiple sports (Suchomel et al., 2021). Research demonstrates that plyometric training significantly improves RSI in both adult and youth athletes, and that RSI naturally decreases through heavy training cycles and with accumulated load, making it valuable for monitoring fatigue and athlete readiness (Ramirez-Campillo et al., 2022).
Despite the extensive research on individual explosive power metrics, several critical gaps in the literature create opportunities for meaningful contributions through this analysis. First, while numerous studies examine single sports or athlete populations, comprehensive comparisons of explosive power metrics across different team sports within the same competitive level remain limited. Most published research focuses on elite international athletes or general recreational populations, with less attention to the NCAA Division I collegiate level where developmental trajectories are critical for both athletic and professional success. Second, while research demonstrates that RSI and related metrics can monitor training response and athlete readiness, systematic longitudinal tracking across competitive seasons integrating multiple explosive power metrics is rarely reported in team sport settings. Most intervention studies last between six and sixteen weeks, missing the seasonal variation patterns crucial for understanding how athletes respond to periodized training, competition stress, and recovery cycles throughout an entire academic and athletic year. Third, recent literature emphasizes that jump height alone may not capture the full picture of neuromuscular function, yet comprehensive analysis of how multiple explosive power metrics relate to each other in creating distinct athlete profiles remains underdeveloped. Understanding whether athletes demonstrate force-dominant versus velocity-dominant characteristics, and how these profiles relate to sport-specific performance outcomes, represents a valuable area for investigation.
The proposed research question addresses these literature gaps by examining how explosive power profiles, characterized by the five selected metrics, differ across SBU athletic teams and what longitudinal patterns emerge across competitive seasons. This investigation will provide normative ranges for each metric by sport at the Division I collegiate level, filling a critical gap in published benchmarking data. By tracking athletes across full competitive seasons rather than short intervention periods, the research will characterize how explosive power naturally fluctuates with training periodization, competition schedules, and recovery demands in authentic team sport environments. The analysis will investigate correlations and potential trade-offs between metrics, revealing whether distinct explosive power profiles emerge that may inform position-specific training or individualized development programs. Additionally, by establishing performance thresholds based on combined metric analysis, the research will provide evidence-based criteria for identifying athletes requiring intervention due to performance decline, accumulated fatigue, or elevated injury risk.
This analysis will be valuable for both scientific and practical applications. From a scientific perspective, establishing collegiate-level normative data across multiple sports and tracking longitudinal performance patterns will contribute to the limited body of research examining explosive power in team sport athletes during authentic competitive seasons. The investigation of metric interrelationships and profile identification will advance understanding of how different components of explosive power interact to support athletic performance. From a practical standpoint, strength and conditioning coaches will gain sport-specific benchmarks for assessing recruit potential, individualized performance tracking relative to team norms, early warning indicators of performance decline or overtraining, and data-driven evaluation tools for training program effectiveness. Understanding which metrics respond most strongly to specific training stimuli will enable more targeted and efficient development programs tailored to individual athlete needs and sport demands. The development of evidence-based performance monitoring systems, including objective criteria for identifying athletes requiring intervention, will support proactive load management and injury risk reduction strategies. By bridging the gap between laboratory-based biomechanics research and practical performance monitoring in competitive athletics, this work will provide immediately actionable insights for optimizing athlete development and performance at the Division I collegiate level while contributing meaningful knowledge to the sports science literature.
